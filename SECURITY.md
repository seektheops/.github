#### Reporting a Vulnerability

Providing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is crucial to demonstrate the issue. While not strictly mandatory, it is essential for the finding to be considered valid. Duplicate reports are not eligible for consideration or payment. Submissions should adhere to the guidelines and scope outlined in the project's documentation to ensure proper evaluation and acknowledgment.
