<sub>All relevant information can be found under the Discussions tab. The pinned repositories feature ongoing audit competitions and bug bounty programs. Please ensure you thoroughly review and understand the documentation for each project before getting started. Reports should be submitted under the Security tab of the respective repository. Reward amounts are not disclosed upfront, as we are a non-profit organization committed to the belief that cybersecurity should be driven by the desire to enhance digital safety, not by payment expectations. We believe this approach will help shape the future of cybersecurity. Rest assured, compensation will be provided. You may even find yourself as the sole participant in a $1,000,000 audit competitionâ€”who knows? This year could be your lucky year. Best of luck, and happy hacking!</sub>
