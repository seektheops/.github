<sub>All information needed to get started is available under the Discussions tab. All pinned repositories are active audit competitions and bug bounty programs. Be sure to read and fully understand the README file of these projects. Reports can be submitted under the Security tab of each repository. Reward amounts are not disclosed in advance, as we are a non-profit organization committed to the belief that cybersecurity should be driven by doing the right thing, not by expectations of payment. We believe this approach will contribute to a safer digital world. Rest assured, compensation will be provided. You might be the sole participant in a $100,000 auditing competitionâ€”who knows? Today could be your lucky day. Good luck, and happy hacking!</sub>
